# Autosar Test Examples
Welcome to the Autosar Test Examples repository. This is a collection of demonstration examples related to Autosar Adaptive Platform functionalities and unit tests. The main purpose of this repository is to serve as an educational tool and a starting point for those who are interested in learning and exploring the AUTOSAR standard in a practical, hands-on way.

Overview
AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture) is an open and standardized automotive software architecture jointly developed by automobile manufacturers, suppliers, and tool developers. In particular, this repository focuses on examples related to the AUTOSAR Adaptive Platform, which is designed to offer greater flexibility and enable the use of high-level operating systems and powerful microprocessors in automotive software.

The examples in this repository are purely illustrative and do not represent production-ready code. They are intended to provide a basic understanding of AUTOSAR Adaptive Platform features, including communication management, service-oriented architecture (SOA), and other related topics.

Contents
In this repository, you will find:

A variety of examples that demonstrate different AUTOSAR Adaptive Platform functionalities.
Unit tests that accompany each example, to illustrate how to verify the functionality and correctness of the AUTOSAR modules.
These examples are not intended to cover the entire scope of the AUTOSAR Adaptive Platform. Instead, they highlight key concepts and provide a practical context for understanding the basics of the standard.

Usage
To use the examples in this repository:

Clone or download the repository.
Follow the instructions provided with each example to set up and run the code.
Run the accompanying unit tests to validate the functionality of the code.
Please note that some familiarity with the AUTOSAR standard and C++ programming is assumed. If you're new to these topics, you may want to familiarize yourself with them before diving into the examples.

Contributions
This is an open-source project, and contributions are welcome. If you have an idea for an example or unit test, or if you find a bug, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

Disclaimer
This is a test repository with examples of AUTOSAR Adaptive functions and unit tests. The examples are designed for learning purposes and are not suitable for use in a production environment.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you need further assistance.
